<darkblue>Village expansion

All villages start off small around a central building (of varying nature: fort, palace, monastery, etc ... commonly referred to as the "town hall"), with a few houses or other buildings. The villagers' main goal is to expand their village by selecting new buildings to build and improvements to existing buildings. For that reason, they need resources - they can produce some themselves (lumbermen harvest wood, and miners stone ...) but depend on the player for others. Their material needs for the planned construction are displayed in the main building. You can help by selling these resources first.

The village population will also increase over time - at night, married villagers can have children. Once grown, these children move into new homes if available and become adults.

The expansion of a village will cease in general two ways: either because the village has completed all buildable structures, or because it has no place. In the latter case, you can look at the village map to see which areas are unbuildable. It is sometimes possible to make them buildable, for example by filling in a lake.

Sometimes, a village needs a block type that you can't craft yourself, such as Norman and Japanese timber frames. You must wait until the village builds a workshop and settles a child there as a craftsman.
