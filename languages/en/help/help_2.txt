<darkblue>Commerce

Your most common exchanges with the villagers will be trading - you can sell many goods to them, and in return buy products, including blocks and objects specific to Millénaire. To trade with a village, go to the main building (or another store) and wait for a villager to come and see you with "Selling to the player" showing above his head. Then <darkblue>right-click<black>  him to open the trade screen.

Millénaire villagers can only sell you items that they have in stock, and you can only sell them items that the village needs (variable depending on the village).

All trade with the village is in "denier", a medieval French currency. There are three types of deniers: standard deniers, “deniers argent” (silver deniers) worth 64 deniers, and “deniers or” (gold deniers) worth 64 deniers argent.

<darkgreen>Tip: On the village map (obtained by right-clicking the corresponding  panel in the village’s central building), stores are listed when you hover your cursor over the buildings.
