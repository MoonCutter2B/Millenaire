Millénaire: Mayan Villagers

Village Leaders:

Ajaw or Chanan: Mayan Kings. Mayan kings were considered to be godlike. They were the centers of power for the Mayan civilization. Each Mayan city-state was controlled by a dynasty of kings, who collectively drove the empire forward. Every single Mayan king created some form of monument to prove his power, some still stand, while some are in ruin. Mayan kings were expected to legitimize their claim to power. One of the ways to do this was to build a temple or pyramid.
