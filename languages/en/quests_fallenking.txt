fallenking_1_firstomens_0_label=Dark Omens
fallenking_1_firstomens_0_description=$name… Have you studied the Cycles recently? The mysterious people from whom you come must have some knowledge of astronomy!  I studied the stars, made sacrifices and yet nothing is clear. But I feel that the future is bleak.  And there are not only omens.  I have received information from other shamans that is very disturbing.  Help me find out what is going on, I'm very worried!
fallenking_1_firstomens_0_description_refuse=May the Gods spare us!
fallenking_1_firstomens_0_description_success=I will prepare a new sacrifice to the Gods so they will grant me more information. I will need you to bring me acceptable offerings. Since we no longer use human prisoners, the remains of the demons that haunt the nights here will suffice. 
fallenking_1_firstomens_1_label=Bring back goods to sacrifice
fallenking_1_firstomens_1_description=What are you bringing me, $name?
fallenking_1_firstomens_1_description_success=You are a mighty hunter. The Gods will be satisfied and will help us. Let me do the rituals and come back to see me.
fallenking_1_firstomens_1_listing=I must bring the shaman rotten flesh, bones, and spider eyes.
fallenking_2_warpreparations_0_label=War Preparations
fallenking_2_warpreparations_0_description=The Gods have accepted my sacrifice and sent me omens. I have also had news from the powerful shaman of a distant village, and they are not good. I assume you have heard of the powerful King Ixtab K’u Ix? No? So you are not omniscient after all!<ret><ret>I will explain. But first, I must think of our village. I know you can forge weapons much more powerful than our obsidian blades. Our chief $localleader_villagername$ could put them to good use to protect us in this ominous cycle. I must ask you for help!
fallenking_2_warpreparations_0_description_refuse=May the Gods spare us!
fallenking_2_warpreparations_0_description_success=I believe four blades and two armours will be sufficient. But I am not a warrior. He will let you know more precisely what we need.
fallenking_2_warpreparations_1_label=Gather weapons
fallenking_2_warpreparations_1_description=Our shaman worries me. He has always known how to guide us in those troubled cycles, and if he sees war on the horizon, I believe him. What have you brought to help us?
fallenking_2_warpreparations_1_description_success=Those weapons are impressive! Our smiths are truly children compared to those of other cultures.
fallenking_2_warpreparations_1_listing=I must bring back iron swords and armours to the village chief.
fallenking_3_thecamp_0_label=On the trace of the King.
fallenking_3_thecamp_0_description=Now that our village can defend itself, I must tell you about King Ixtab K’u Ix. He is a powerful lord, who ruled over a large part of the Yucatan in the old world. He has managed to federate multiple Mayan villages since we arrived here. He is said to be strict and haughty, but the Gods favour him and he has done much for our people. I have recently received a strange message from his personal shaman, Tohil Uchben, a brilliant and ambitious man. He speaks of a fascinating discovery he made with his liege. He gives no further information, save that it relates to Xibalba, the land of the dead! I am worried, $name. I fear there is a link with the sinister omens that haunt me. King Ixtab and his shaman have perhaps found something dangerous in this strange world. Could you investigate?
fallenking_3_thecamp_0_description_refuse= May the Gods spare us!
fallenking_3_thecamp_0_description_success=I do not have much information, but Tohil Uchben was writing from a camp in the forest or jungle that seemed linked to their discovery, whatever it may be. Search, and I will continue my sacrifices so that the Gods may guide you.
fallenking_3_thecamp_1_label=Talk to the Shaman
fallenking_3_thecamp_1_description=You have travelled a long time, and dark omens have come in your absence. What are the news? Have you found King Ixtab or Tohil Uchben?
fallenking_3_thecamp_1_description_success=A purple gate opening to a world of flames! I had never thought they could have found something so incredible! And so dangerous. I do not know if it is the door to Xibalba or a sinister joke from a malevolent God but those news terrify me. And why did the King’s troops attack you without reason? The Mayans are not a peaceful people, but such aggressiveness is abnormal. And why that empty jail in the camp? I do not know what to think. I am confused, $name. I will consult the Gods once more.
fallenking_3_thecamp_1_listing=I must explore to find King Ixtab's camp in the jungle or forest, then go back and see the shaman.
fallenking_4_newomens_0_label=New Sacrifices
fallenking_4_newomens_0_description=$name, I have made many sacrifices without the Gods answering. They will no longer take my offerings! Their greediness is without bounds, and they always demand more before granting me help. We need something new to offer them – a rare sacrifice, that requires strength and bravery to gather. Will you help me again?
fallenking_4_newomens_0_description_refuse= May the Gods spare us!
fallenking_4_newomens_0_description_success=I believe I know what will satisfy them: that item you found next to that accursed gate. I can feel it comes from a mighty creature. This will be a sacrifice to which the Gods will feel compel to answer! Could you bring me back some of the crystal tears?
fallenking_4_newomens_1_label=Gather the tears
fallenking_4_newomens_1_description=Could you find the creatures that produce those tears? Could you sacrifice enough of them?
fallenking_4_newomens_1_description_success=So they come from floating creatures breathing fire? And you could triumph over them? $name, you too are not what it seems. Are you also from Xibalba? I will ask the Gods when sacrificing those tears. Come and see me afterward.
fallenking_4_newomens_1_listing=I must bring back four Ghast tears to the shaman.
fallenking_5_thepyramid_0_label=The Obsidian Pyramid
fallenking_5_thepyramid_0_description=The Gods send me a vivid omen, $name: the image of a massive Mayan pyramid with an obsidian temple at the very top. It can only be one place… Keban Muul, a monument built a long time ago to honour Ah Puch and where endless sacrifices were held before it was abandoned. I believe King Ixtab has set up there. The Gods only know why! You must find him and end his dealings with Xibalba!
fallenking_5_thepyramid_0_description_refuse= May the Gods spare us!
fallenking_5_thepyramid_0_description_success=I do not know where this pyramid lies, but it was at the heart of a forest. Travel while I make sacrifices to the Gods so that they may grant you victory.
fallenking_6_thesiege_0_label=The King’s Shaman
fallenking_6_thesiege_0_description=By Ach Puch, who are you? You killed King Ixtab and massacred his army on your own! You looked like the God Buluc Chabtan himself!<ret><ret>But whoever you may be, you cannot be worse than the demon which haunts this place... Ever since we uncovered that malevolent Portal in the jungle and visited Xibalba the King seemed possessed by some sinister force. He took us to this old and cursed temple... He stopped dreaming of anything but gold and conquests, and vowed to sacrifice all the neighbouring villages to Ach Puch in person! He had always been ambitious, but until then never bloodthirsty. I had taught him since his childhood and yet could no longer understand him. And when I opposed his dark plans, he made me prisoner, me, his oldest and most loyal follower! But I do not believe it was still him speaking. And now I hope this all ended with his death. Will you help me travel back home?
fallenking_6_thesiege_0_description_refuse=I will stay here then, where my King died.
fallenking_6_thesiege_0_description_success=Wait... I can feel something. We are in danger! I cannot fight - please let me stay here and go and see what is happening. I fear the worse.
fallenking_6_thesiege_1_label=Saved!
fallenking_6_thesiege_1_description=Your fighting skills are impressive... Did you know it took ten of King Ixtab’s elite warriors to kill a single of those huge white creatures in the other world? And you shot them down as if they were flies! But we must be wary. It seems like the demon or God that manipulated my King does not want to see us live, whether from vengeance or fear... Let me collect myself and we will see what to do. Rest as well; I do not doubt your skills as a warrior will be needed again.
fallenking_6_thesiege_1_description_success=We shall speak again soon.
fallenking_6_thesiege_1_listing=I must defend the pyramid and the shaman against the demonic hordes.
fallenking_7_thepit_0_label=The Chamber of Lava
fallenking_7_thepit_0_description=When we reached the pyramid, the King took me down to a room deep below. In the middle of it was an obsidian pool filled with lava. He was already half-demented at this stage and rambled as to how he would make his most sacrifices there, throwing in the pool the leaders of every village that opposed him. I do not believe his feverish rants meant much, but I do wonder what purpose that pool had. And where does the lava come from? You should find out.
fallenking_7_thepit_0_description_refuse=I will stay here then, where my King died.
fallenking_7_thepit_0_description_success=The staircase next to my jail leads there. You might have to follow the lava... Here, take those fiery foods I traded from an Indian village. They will allow you to resist the lava. And drink this cacauhaa. If you reach a dark place, it will help you see.
fallenking_7_thepit_1_label=The trap
fallenking_7_thepit_1_description=Could you find the source of the lava?
fallenking_7_thepit_1_description_success=You look weary, $name. And you say that there was nothing... only monsters spawning in empty rooms... I was not expecting that.<ret><ret>$name, I see only one possibility: this well was a trap, intended to eliminate enterprising explorers. It is scant comfort after so much effort, but you are clearly stronger than the demon that designed this trap anticipated.
fallenking_7_thepit_1_listing=I need to find the source of the lava in the room behind the prison.
fallenking_8_sacrifice_0_label=Warrior's Sacrifices
fallenking_8_sacrifice_0_description=I was hesitant to speak of it with you, $name, but after your fight in the underground chamber you have more than earned the right to share my knowledge. If King Ixtab spared me when I opposed him, it is because he needed my skills in communicating with the Gods. Since I first arrived in this new world, I have made many sacrifices and often drunk the holy Cacauhaa, and I obtained from the Gods that they help the King’s warriors by binding spells to their arms and armours. The Gods demand much blood in return for powerful enchantments, but the weapons obtained are formidable. The King wanted to keep those rituals for the sole use of his warriors – but I can no longer risk a single man having access to such powerful weapons. Go and see a shaman for me and share those rituals with him.
fallenking_8_sacrifice_0_description_refuse=I will stay here then, where my King died.
fallenking_8_sacrifice_0_description_success=Safe travels, $name. Come back to see me afterward. I will stay here and speak to the Gods. I do not believe we are done with this pyramid.
fallenking_8_sacrifice_1_label= Return to the shaman
fallenking_8_sacrifice_1_description=I am speaking with the Gods. They always want more sacrifices!
fallenking_8_sacrifice_1_description_success=It is done then.  I am no longer the only shaman able to enchant weapons.  I hope I did well.
fallenking_8_sacrifice_1_listing=I must convey the rituals of Tohil Uchben to a village shaman.
fallenking_9_backtothevillage_0_label=New rituals
fallenking_9_backtothevillage_0_description=You want to talk to me, $name ?
fallenking_9_backtothevillage_0_description_refuse=I shall return to my rituals, in this case.
fallenking_9_backtothevillage_0_description_success=Those rituals are dark! Terrifying even. Tohil Uchben has great powers and he had to sacrifice a lot to get this knowledge.  But I can do it if you bring the blood the Gods will claim. Come to see me at the altar of sacrifices.
fallenking_10_thebrokendoor_0_label=The Source of Evil
fallenking_10_thebrokendoor_0_description=In your absence, I redoubled my sacrifices and Yum Kaax, God of Maze, sent me a message. I believe he is jealous of the success of the demon responsible for this place. In any case, he helped me locate the source of evil that haunts this place. It is underground but deeper and better hidden than the room you found. Are you ready to face those forces again?
fallenking_10_thebrokendoor_0_description_refuse=I will stay here then, where my King died.
fallenking_10_thebrokendoor_0_description_success=Ah Puch protects you, $name. If it was not him who made this place!
fallenking_10_thebrokendoor_1_label=The broken door
fallenking_10_thebrokendoor_1_description=Is it finally over, brave $name ?
fallenking_10_thebrokendoor_1_description_success=A door, like the one you had found, but made of indestructible matter and... broken.  It must open in the universe from which the one behind all this comes! But how can we follow him? An ocean of sacrifices would not grant us such favour from the gods.  $name, I fear that your efforts will end here.  For the moment, anyway.<ret><ret>But do not think it was in vain! The human money and weapons you found at the bottom shows the demon was about to use King Ixtab to launch a war in those lands.  And that he left them behind shows that he fled hurriedly at your approach! You might not have defeated him, but you forced it to withdraw. Few men can boast of having done that to a demon.  I salute you, $name.<ret><ret>And I think it is fair that I hand this over to you; I found it in the pyramid in your absence: the crown I had made for King Ixtab.  No one other than you is worthy of it now.  Wear it hence, and it will protect you and allow you to swim underwater like the caiman. Use it well. And know also that the man who possesses it will be recognised throughout Mayan lands as King.  If you wish to build your own city, the Mayans will follow you. Farewell, $name.
fallenking_10_thebrokendoor_1_listing=I have to explore the source of evil in the pyramid revealed to the shaman.
