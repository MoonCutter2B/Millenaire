sadhu_intro_0_description=$name, we have known you for a long time now, and you know we trust you as one of us, despite never asking who you were or where you came from. Originally, we thought that you were simply a man from another nation that like us had been carried here on the fateful day where the earth shook and we found ourselves in this strange land, where the seasons never change and the rivers do not flow - someone like those strange men in their stone pyramids, or the white-faced men skilled in the forging of iron.<ret><ret>But we have observed you long, and you are different. You seem to have no memory of an earlier land, and thrive here as if you belonged. And yet we have never met anyone else of your kind.<ret><ret>If you know more than we do and do not want to share it, that is your right. But if - as I suspect - you wonder yourself what strange world you roam and what is your place in it, you need wisdom I do not have. One man only that I have heard of can help you: my old guru, Sadhu Vidya. I have not seen him in many years, but I know he wanders in the forest, choosing tall and strong trees for shelter. When you meet him, convey to him my thanks for the wisdom he shared with me.

sadhu_first_0_label=Initiation
sadhu_first_0_description=I was expecting you, $name. Villagers visit me to seek advice, and I have been told many times about the stranger without a past that befriends Indian villages and seems at home in this wild world we have all been sent to. You must have been told by some village elder that I would answer your questions. It will not be so easy. My knowledge was great in the old world on the banks of the Holy Ganges, but here I must learn everything anew. If you seek a Guru, you have come in vain.<ret><ret>However... Before I retired to a life of meditation, I was skilled in the knowledge of the natural world. There was not a plant I could not name or use between the Himalayas and the jungles of the south. And while my body has grown frail, my mind is still sharp. Help me study this world and you too will learn much about it. But be warned: not all creatures here are peaceful, and I belive we may face... resistance when exploring this world.

Start at sunset, and spend the night strolling through it, observing.<ret><ret>I do not need to remind you that outdoors are dangerous when the sun is down, but the gods will watch over you. Carrying a sword would be a good idea as well â€“ I have noticed that well-prepared warriors enjoy more effective divine protection.

sadhu_3_pandit_0_label=Hindu epics
sadhu_3_pandit_0_description=I have reflected long on your misadventures in the forest, and illumination eludes me. Those grotesque caricatures of men are unlike anything I had ever seen in our disappeared world, and I cannot understand their existence of purpose. There are however talks of demons in ancient Hindu epics that could relate to them. My solitary existence prevents me from keeping such expensive parchments, but you should be able to find them in Indian villages.
sadhu_3_pandit_0_description_success=I need a library of my own... The life of a sadhu has its drawbacks.

sadhu_4_desertb_0_description=The great epics are a source of wisdom, in this world like the old one. Many great heros and gods fought against demons in the old times, and the knowledge of their prowess will surely help protect you against evil in this dark world. I believe I can use this knowledge to protect you, but I will need to fast to purify myself first.<ret><ret>While I prepare myself, I want you to continue your work and gather information on this world's barren wastelands, where humans rarely go. Maybe you will meet less opposition there. Go and explore the first desert you find like you explored the forest.

sadhu_4_desertb_1_description_success= Your description of the desert as "barren" and "sandy" does little to increase our knowledge, $name. But it is interesting that you noticed more of those walking skeletons than previously. The land itself seems to react to you exploring it.<ret><ret>In your absence, I have prayed long and hard, and Vishnu in his infinite widsom chose to bless our quest. He has granted me the knowledge to feel evil around me, and to pour it in this amulet. Take it, and let it protect you.

sadhu_5_adivasi_0_label=Marsh expert
sadhu_5_adivasi_0_description=$name, we need to continue gathering information on this world. I believe the marshes to be particularly important places as they seem to be present far more than natural forces would suggest. Thankfully for you, there will be no need to explore them yourself. There are people whose knowledge of them is unmatched: the adivasi farmers. Those men are poor and looked down upon by the villagers, but they are observant and spend their lives deep in the marshes. Find one and ask him for information. Tell him you are coming on my behalf and he will be welcoming.

I have also seen dark creatures wander in the marshes at night, and some burst into flames when the day comes! I have collected some of the remains of those foul things, maybe the Holy Man can understand what abomination this is?<ret><ret>And I pray you will accept this food before you leave, $name. Whoever works for the Sadhu must be a good man.

sadhu_6_enchantedsword_0_description=The adivasi's tales are dark, $name. Even with your amulet, how can you feel safe exploring this land when demons roam freely when the sun is set? I have read again the epics in your absence, and I feel I know what you need: a holy weapon to protect you, something mighty and terrible like the fearsome Sudarshana Chakra wielded by Lord Vishnu himself. But even after three days of fast, my meditation goes unanswered. I fear my knowledge is failing me. $name, your connection to this world is far greater than mine, though we do not understand it - do you believe you could obtain a holy blade to fight off this evil?

sadhu_6_enchantedsword_1_description_success=Such power is in you, that you did not request a magical weapon from the Gods, but forged it yourself! Your inborn knowledge of this world frightens me, $name. I sometime wonder if you are just a man. Leave me now. I need to pray for guidance.

sadhu_8_mountain_1_description_success= So this time it was spiders that troubled your night-time explorations? I have seen those at night, lurking near this tree. But what do they mean? Why are they present even in mountains where they do not fit? It is a worrying sign, creatures that do not belong to the places they roam.

sadhu_11_pujas_0_description=While you have explored the sea, I have focused all my thoughts on this mystery you left me - the enchantment table. I have struggled to decipher the books and the secrets of the construction of the table itself, and understood nothing. But wisdom came in my meditations: the table and the books do not matter. A practical man like you need them, a material support for you to focus on. But the power is not in them, it is in you and the world. And there are other ways to harness it.<ret><ret>I believe even a village pandit can do something similar, with proper training. I want you to go to the nearest Indian village and take this parchment to its priest. With the hymns I have written on it, he should be able to pray the gods to bless tools you give him, provided you give him proper offerings for the deities.
sadhu_11_pujas_0_description_success=I could not bring myself to write hymns of war, so he will be limited to blessing tools, not weapons.

sadhu_11b_pandit_0_description=Why would the Sadhu want me to sing new hymns, when all wisdom is in the old one? If he was not such a holy man I would wonder if he has not stayed too long in the forest. But I will perform pujas with those for you if you want. Come see me in the temple with your offerings, my fee and the tool you want blessed.

sadhu_12_topandbottom_0_label=Limits of the world
sadhu_12_topandbottom_0_description=$name, there is a last challenge I need you to undertake for me. I know from reports of courageous Indian explorers that this new world is vast - in the first few years after the night of fire which took us here, many young Indian villagers travelled far and wide to find known shores again, in vain. They also never saw any mountain that is worthy of that name, something to rival the mighty Himalayas. I have thought hard about it, and this has come to my mind: the sky here looks as high as it ever was over the plains of the Ganges, but the clouds are always low, and never do we see any birds or creature above them. Could it be that everything above them is an illusion? You need to go and see for yourself what is there above the clouds.

Is this world a mockery of the real one then, the work of a demon or a god? $name, you must confirm this finding. You must see if this world is finite downward as well, if this ground we live in is but a thin slice of earth floating on nothingness.

sadhu_12_topandbottom_2_description_success=So you met rocks too hard to break and could go downward no further. And you say this was the height of thirty men below the surface. There is too much symmetry at work here, $name. It cannot be, and yet it is.<ret><ret>I have no more work for you now. I need to think and meditate and pray for guidance, until I can make sense of all of this. Come back in some time and I will give you the results of my finding, if Lord Ganesh inspires me.

But I was not worthy enough to uncover the truth, just to glimpse at aspects of it.<ret><ret>$name, I am too tired to speak now. I have written my findings in this scroll. Take it and have my blessings in your quest for knowledge, I do not believe I can do more for you at present. You may need more wisdom than an old sadhu ever had.
sadhu_13_conclusion_0_description_success=I have written this parchment in the holy language of Sanskrit, which only a few pandits master anymore. But somehow I knew you would be able to understand it. The Goddess whispers in your ear, even if you cannot hear her.
